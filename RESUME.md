# RESUME: Christopher Stephen Wilson

**Minister-Technologist • Machinist-Mystic • Builder of Sacred-Decentralized Systems**

Systems-minded Web3 and blockchain developer with 18+ years of precision manufacturing experience, transitioning into decentralized systems engineering with a focus on privacy-preserving technology and sacred innovation.

I bring deterministic, high-reliability systems thinking from aerospace and entertainment manufacturing into smart contract development, DAO governance, zero-knowledge cryptography, and privacy-aware Web3 applications. My work focuses on building systems that honor human dignity, protect personal sovereignty, and nurture pathways of healing and awakening.

## 🌟 Mission Statement

My mission is to build systems — spiritual, technological, and communal — that honor human dignity, protect personal sovereignty, and nurture pathways of healing and awakening. I combine precision engineering with zero-knowledge privacy, decentralized governance, and ministerial presence to create tools that empower individuals, strengthen communities, and reflect the sacred interconnectedness of all life.

## 📚 Philosophy

Technology, like music and mycelium, can become a vessel for the sacred. Systems can be designed to honor the dignity of the human soul — rooted in privacy, gratitude, humility, and compassion.

**Precision matters.** The same care once required to machine aerospace-grade components now shapes decentralized architectures, cryptographic systems, and ritual intelligence.

**The mycelial model offers a blueprint for healthy systems.** Interdependence without domination. Resilience without centralization. Growth through mutual nourishment.

**Psychedelic insight serves as a doorway, not a destination.** Transformation becomes enduring only when integrated through practice, embodied through service, and expressed through daily gratitude.

*"Where code becomes prayer and mycelium becomes architecture."*

**Engineering the sacred: Where prayer and devotion manifest as code.**
